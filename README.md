# XEROstaking

Hello, this is a message from the developer:

The script currently sucks. The settings are working, but I had to scrap the combat class last minute because
of reported account nulling. In the coming time I plan to re-write it from scratch, but currently this script
is pretty bare.

I also removed shards support, due to apparent attempts to scam bots and you just end up in stake window for 20
seconds instead of doing rapid stakes, so that cuts into script efficiency. Will bring it back, though, so stay
tuned.

I plan to re-write this from scratch, as this is currently so poorly written, it makes me ashamed of it, but
due to popular demand and me "kinda" quitting Ikov, this is "it".
